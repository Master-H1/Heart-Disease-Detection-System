# Heart-Disease-Detection-System
This is the project aimed to detect whether someone has heart disease or not.
After a patient finishes conducting laboratory tests, those results have to be sent to the doctor. After that, the doctor fits those results into the model to learn the patterns and determine whether the patient has a presence of heart disease.

The system mimicked the patient care pathway in healthcare centers. The integrated model achieved a high recall score of 0.91, meaning how well a model can identify positive instances in a dataset.
To develop the classification model, we used the dataset found on the Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction.
